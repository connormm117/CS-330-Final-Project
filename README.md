# CS-330 Final Project: 3D Scene with C++ and OpenGL

**Author:** Connor Martin  
**Course:** CS-330 ‚Äî Computational Graphics and Visualization  
**Institution:** Southern New Hampshire University  

## üìå Project Overview
This repository contains my final project for CS 330, where I created a fully interactive 3D scene using C++ and OpenGL. The goal was to replicate a real-world scene from a 2D reference image, using primitive shapes, textures, lighting, and camera controls to produce a polished visualization.

The project demonstrates:
- Low-polygon 3D object creation
- Texture mapping using royalty-free images
- Phong lighting with multiple light sources
- Full camera navigation (WASD, QE, mouse orientation, and zoom)
- Perspective and orthographic projection switching

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **OpenGL**
- **GLFW / GLEW**
- **GLM**
- **stb_image.h**
- **Visual Studio 2022**

## üéØ Key Features
- Four+ 3D objects including combined primitives
- Realistic lighting with both white and colored light sources
- Seamless texture mapping
- Smooth, responsive camera controls
- Modular, well-commented code

## üìÇ Repository Contents
- `3D_Scene_Final.zip` ‚Äì Complete Visual Studio project files & executable
- `Design_Decisions.docx` ‚Äì Documentation of my design process and decisions
- `README.md` ‚Äì This document

## üìù Reflection

**How I approach designing software:**  
When designing software, I start with a clear understanding of the problem and break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. For this project, I began by studying the reference image, identifying the basic shapes needed, and mapping them to OpenGL primitives. This approach ensured that I maintained a balance between visual accuracy and performance.

**New design skills developed:**  
Working on this project strengthened my ability to visualize 3D space, plan object placement, and think in terms of geometry. I also refined my skills in texture mapping, lighting design, and modular code structure, which are all critical for professional 3D graphics work.

**Design process followed:**  
I followed an iterative design process:
1. Analyze reference and determine objects/shapes.
2. Build each object individually.
3. Apply textures and materials.
4. Add and adjust lighting.
5. Refine object positioning for realism.

**Applying tactics in the future:**  
This structured breakdown and iterative refinement can be applied to any future project‚Äîespecially when balancing visual detail with performance considerations in game design, simulations, or VR applications.

**How I approach developing programs:**  
I focus on building incrementally‚Äîwriting small, testable sections of code and verifying functionality before moving forward. This minimizes debugging complexity and ensures steady progress.

**New development strategies used:**  
I integrated shader-based lighting early in the build so I could test visual feedback in real time, rather than applying it at the end. I also made use of modular transformation functions to simplify adjustments.

**Iteration in development:**  
Iteration was central to this project. Object positions, scales, and textures were adjusted multiple times as I navigated the 3D space and tested camera views.

**Evolution of my development approach:**  
Earlier in the course, I worked more linearly‚Äîcompleting one object before moving to the next. By the final project, I was comfortable working in parallel on objects, lighting, and navigation to streamline workflow.

**How computer science supports my goals:**  
This project sharpened my problem-solving, spatial reasoning, and programming skills, which are transferable to both graphics-intensive work and broader software development.

**Educational pathway impact:**  
Understanding computational graphics enhances my academic toolkit‚Äîespecially for courses in simulation, visualization, and interactive media.

**Professional pathway impact:**  
Professionally, these skills are relevant for careers in game development, simulation engineering, 3D visualization for architecture, and even medical imaging. This project serves as a strong portfolio example of my ability to take a concept from design to polished, interactive execution.
